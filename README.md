# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Built using predominantly HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and AJAX to develop front-end development skills. Understanding Node, Express and MongoDB inherited on the back end prior to the start of the program helped dictate what we (as students) could do on the front end.

This forked and cloned repository is my final representation of the project main requirements. Any additional stretch work for the time being can be found on branches rather than master.
